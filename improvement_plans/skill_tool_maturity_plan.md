# AgentWorkbench: Skill & Tool Maturity Plan - Phase 1

## 1. Rationale and Goals
Many skills and tools within AgentWorkbench were initially created as placeholders or with very basic functionality to establish the framework. The "Skill & Tool Maturity" initiative aims to incrementally enhance these components, making them more robust, functional, and closer to real-world usability.

**Core Goals for this Initiative:**
- **Enhance Functionality:** Implement or expand the core logic of placeholder skills/tools.
- **Improve Error Handling:** Make components more resilient to unexpected inputs or external issues.
- **Integrate with External Services:** Where appropriate, connect skills to live APIs or data sources (while ensuring testability through mocking).
- **Increase Configurability:** Allow key parameters to be set via the `config/settings.py` file or at runtime.
- **Add Comprehensive Testing:** Ensure all matured components have thorough unit tests.

This document will track the progress of this initiative, starting with `NewsSkill`.

## 2. Phase 1 Implementation: `NewsSkill` Enhancement (Completed)

### a. Initial State
The `NewsSkill` was initially a placeholder without actual data fetching capabilities.

### b. Enhancements Made
- **Data Source:** Integrated with the live BBC News RSS feed (`http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml`) as a default source. The RSS URL can also be customized when instantiating the skill.
- **Functionality:**
    - Fetches news headlines using the `requests` library.
    - Parses the XML content of the RSS feed using `xml.etree.ElementTree`.
    - Extracts a specified number of headlines (defaulting to 5).
    - Includes a fallback mechanism to parse items directly under the RSS root if the standard `channel/item` path yields no results.
    - Returns a list of headline strings.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Handles potential network errors during fetching (e.g., `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, HTTP errors via `response.raise_for_status()`).
    - Handles XML parsing errors (`ET.ParseError`).
    - Returns an empty list `[]` in case of errors, with error messages printed to the console.
- **Unit Tests:**
    - Comprehensive unit tests were added in `AgentWorkbench/tests/test_news_skill.py`.
    - Tests use `unittest.mock` to simulate `requests.get` calls, providing mock RSS data (valid, empty, malformed).
    - Coverage includes successful headline retrieval, HTTP errors, request timeouts, parsing errors, and handling of empty feeds.

## 3. Future Candidates for Skill/Tool Maturity

The following skills and tools are key candidates for future enhancement efforts:

### Skills:
- **`FinanceSkill`:**
    - **Current State:** Placeholder.
    - **Potential Enhancements:**
        - Integrate with a free financial data API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance unofficial API) to fetch stock prices, market news, or cryptocurrency data.
        - Implement methods for specific queries (e.g., `get_stock_price(symbol)`, `get_market_summary()`).
        - Add error handling for API rate limits, invalid symbols, etc.
        - Make API keys configurable.
- **`LLMSkill`:**
    - **Current State:** Placeholder, requires API keys.
    - **Potential Enhancements:**
        - Implement interaction with a specific LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, a local Ollama instance).
        - Define clear methods for different types of LLM tasks (e.g., `generate_text`, `summarize`, `answer_question`).
        - Handle API errors, context length issues, etc.
        - Ensure API keys are configurable and securely managed.
- **`TranslationSkill`:**
    - **Current State:** Placeholder.
    - **Potential Enhancements:**
        - Integrate with a translation API (e.g., Google Translate API (paid), or a free alternative if available and suitable).
        - Methods for `translate(text, target_language, source_language=None)`.
- **`WeatherSkill`:**
    - **Current State:** Placeholder.
    - **Potential Enhancements:**
        - Integrate with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com) to fetch current weather or forecasts.
        - Methods like `get_current_weather(location)`, `get_forecast(location, days=1)`.
        - Handle location ambiguity and API errors.

### Tools:
- **`DBTool` (`SQLiteTool`):**
    - **Current State:** Implemented as a simple key-value store using SQLite. Tests added.
    - **Potential Enhancements (beyond current K/V scope):**
        - Support for more complex SQL queries if needed by agents (e.g., allowing execution of arbitrary SELECTs, or more structured table interactions). This would require significant changes and careful security considerations (SQL injection).
        - Configuration for different database backends (though this might be overly complex for its current "tool" status).
- **`KnowledgeBaseTool`:**
    - **Current State:** Simple in-memory dictionary. Tests added.
    - **Potential Enhancements:**
        - Option for persistence (e.g., saving/loading to/from a file like JSON or CSV).
        - More advanced query capabilities (e.g., fuzzy matching for questions, semantic search if integrated with embeddings).
        - Could potentially use `SQLiteTool` as a backend for persistence.

## 4. General Approach for Maturing Components
- **Define Scope:** Clearly define the target functionality for the specific skill/tool being matured.
- **Identify Data Sources/APIs:** Research and select appropriate external services if needed.
- **Implement Core Logic:** Write the code to achieve the defined functionality.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for both internal logic and external interactions.
- **Configuration:** Externalize key parameters (API keys, URLs, default behaviors) to `config/settings.py`.
- **Testing:** Develop thorough unit tests, mocking all external dependencies.
- **Documentation:** Update any relevant READMEs or create new documentation for the matured component.

This plan provides a roadmap for systematically improving the capabilities and reliability of AgentWorkbench's skills and tools.
