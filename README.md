# Agent-Forge
Agent Forge is a modular, extensible workbench for designing, building, testing and evolving AI agents.



### 1. Project Vision & High-Level Goals  
(derived from `project_summary.pdf`)

| Theme | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Comprehensive AI workbench | One place to **design ‚Üí build ‚Üí test ‚Üí evaluate ‚Üí evolve** AI agents. |
| Modular abstractions | Clearly separate **Agents, Skills, Tools, Strategies, Teams** so they can be mixed & matched. |
| Declarative configuration | Use lightweight YAML/JSON definitions + Pydantic schemas; keep code & config separate. |
| Safe experimentation | Provide a **sandbox**, logging, guard-rails and an evaluation harness before real-world use. |
| Continuous improvement | Support **automatic evaluation, reflection, supervised evolution** and ultimately multi-agent coordination. |
| Educational / incremental | Blog-style roadmap (Parts 1-20) that walks developers from the ‚ÄúHello, Agent‚Äù up to advanced MAS & ethical guardrails. |

---

### 2. How the Attached Technical Docs Deliver on Those Goals  

| Goal from ¬ß1 | Implementation evidence in `*_model.txt` files |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Modular abstractions | `schemas.py`, `component_registry.py`, YAML folders under `definitions/` for Agents/Skills/Tools/Ethics. |
| Declarative config | Global `config.yaml`; each module loads its settings via `config_loader.py`. |
| Agent instantiation | `agent_builder.py` dynamically imports code and injects skills/tools based on YAML IDs. |
| Behavior strategies | `behavior_tree.py` + strategy YAMLs (`strategies/‚Ä¶`) + `bt_agent.py`. |
| Knowledge / RAG | `knowledge/` package with `document_processor.py`, `vector_store.py`, default ChromaDB config. |
| Observability | Structured JSONL logging (`forge_logging.py`) for both agent steps and evaluation runs. |
| Evaluation harness | `evaluation.py`, `test_cases/*.yaml`, CLI runner `run_forge.py`. |
| Safety & ethics | `safety_guardrails.py`, YAML-based ethical frameworks; input/output guard-rails called inside agents. |
| Supervised evolution | `evolution_controller.py` + failure-analysis snippets (see `254_model.txt`) create modified agent drafts for human review. |
| MAS path | `coordinator_agent.py`, `TeamDefinition` schema, stub `mas_runner.py`. |

Current state = ‚ÄúBaseline‚Äù: everything needed up to Blog 20 is present and runnable; advanced items are stubbed but scaffolded.

### 3. Road-map Check-in  

Phase | Intended in Blog series | Status in code drops
------|------------------------|---------------------
Foundation (1-5) | Basic agent, skills/tools, config, registry | ‚úÖ Complete
Core Workbench (6-10) | Builder, sandbox, evaluation, tracing, UI prototype | ‚úÖ Code for all except sandbox UI partially implemented (UI stub present)
Enhanced (11-15) | Memory/RAG, behavior trees, coordinator | ‚úÖ Base RAG, BT executor, coordinator agent implemented
Advanced (16-20) | MAS, evolution, guardrails, ethics | üî∂ Structures exist; MAS runner & evolution ops are placeholders; guardrails basic
Beyond 20 | Reflection, auto-evolution, advanced MAS | ‚ö™ Conceptual skeletons only

Legend: ‚úÖ done‚ÄÉüî∂ partial‚ÄÉ‚ö™ not started

### 4. Gaps & Risks  

1. Sandboxing/execution safety is only conceptual ‚Üí agents can still call the network/tools directly.  
2. MAS runner lacks concrete coordination logic beyond hierarchical delegations.  
3. Evolution flow writes temporary YAMLs but no persistence/cleanup & no UI surfacing.  
4. RAG pipeline is minimal (local Chroma only) and needs scaling & doc-type coverage.  
5. Test-case coverage is basic; no stress, adversarial or performance benchmarks.  
6. Streamlit UI stub exists but no interactive component/trace viewers.  
7. No automated CI/CD, linting, static-type checks or code-quality gates yet.  

---

### 5. Recommendations & Next Smart Steps  

Immediate (1-2 weeks)  
‚Ä¢ Finish a simple **sandbox wrapper** (e.g., subprocess + policy) so skills/tools can be safely executed.  
‚Ä¢ Flesh out **UI panels**: component browser, run-history viewer, JSONL trace explorer.  
‚Ä¢ Add **pytest** suite covering registry loading, builder instantiation, one BT execution path.  

Short term (4-6 weeks)  
‚Ä¢ Implement **MASSimulationRunner** for at least ‚Äúhierarchical‚Äù teams; start with coordinator -> workers messages.  
‚Ä¢ Tighten **evaluation harness**: scoring matrix, confusion-matrix style display, auto-upload of failing traces.  
‚Ä¢ Expand **guardrails** using LLM-based red-teaming prompts.  

Medium (2-3 months)  
‚Ä¢ Integrate **persistent vector store** (Qdrant, Weaviate) and streaming token limits.  
‚Ä¢ Add **reflection engine** that can propose BT edits, not just prompt tweaks.  
‚Ä¢ Connect to **OpenTelemetry** or similar for richer observability.  

Organizational  
‚Ä¢ Publish **CONTRIBUTING.md** & **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** (drafts exist) and wire up GitHub Actions for tests + lint.  
‚Ä¢ Decide on **license** (MIT vs Apache-2) and add year/owner placeholders.

### 6. Key Takeaway  

The project is well-architected and the baseline implementation already realizes most of the foundational goals: modular agents, declarative configs, behavior trees, RAG integration, structured logging and an evaluation harness. The next value-added work lies in operationalizing safety (sandboxing), maturing MAS support, and closing the loop on automated reflection/evolution with usable UI and CI pipelines.







### Updated Analysis (incorporating Parts 1-5 Technical Docs)

The newly-added files (236‚Äì244) provide a complete 5-part technical specification that fleshes out every layer of the Agent Forge stack:

| Part | What it Adds | Effect on Previous Gap List |
|------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 ‚Äì Intro & Architecture | Vision, glossary, high-level diagram, tech stack | Confirms architectural intent and component boundaries. |
| 2 ‚Äì Core Components & Schemas | Canonical directory layout, Pydantic schemas, Registry & Builder spec | Removes ambiguity around data contracts; development can proceed with strict validation. |
| 3 ‚Äì Strategy & Execution (BT) | YAML BT format, node semantics, executor spec, BT-Agent impl. | Provides the missing formal spec for BT execution. |
| 4 ‚Äì Evaluation, Tracing, Safety, Knowledge | Harness flow, trace loader, LLM-judge interface, guardrail API, RAG helpers | Clarifies how metrics are produced and where safety hooks belong. |
| 5 ‚Äì User Manual & Dev Guide | Install steps, UI usage, troubleshooting, API reference | Gives end-to-end usage instructions; ready for onboarding and demos. |

Most ‚Äúunknowns‚Äù identified earlier now have written definitions. Remaining *open* items are implementation or operational work, not design.

### Final Implementation & Roll-out Plan

Below is a 7-phase, 12-week roadmap that turns the specification into a stable, demo-ready platform.  
(Assumes three core contributors ‚Äì Alice, Bob, Charlie ‚Äì with occasional reviewer support.)

| Phase | Duration | Owner(s) | Key Deliverables | Success Criteria |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| 0. Alignment & Environment | 1 wk | ALL | ‚Ä¢ Kick-off meeting<br>‚Ä¢ Confirm license (MIT/Apache)<br>‚Ä¢ Adopt `pyproject.toml` & pre-commit hooks | All devs have synced env; lint & tests run locally. |
| 1. Baseline Stabilisation | 2 wks | Bob | ‚Ä¢ Flesh out missing `__init__.py` files<br>‚Ä¢ Implement BT executor per Part 3 spec<br>‚Ä¢ Make Registry+Builder load sample agents<br>‚Ä¢ Unit tests for schemas, builder, executor | `pytest` suite passes; `SimpleAgent_v5` answers math & web-search prompts via CLI. |

Knowledge & MAS Enhancements | 3 wks | Bob (+Alice) | ‚Ä¢ Integrate ChromaDB wrapper & RAG skill<br>‚Ä¢ Implement hierarchical `MASSimulationRunner` for coordinator ‚Üí worker pattern<br>‚Ä¢ Add vector-store ingestion utilities | RAG demo: ask factual question, agent cites document; MAS demo: coordinator delegates search & synthesis to two workers. |
| 5. Reflection & Supervised Evolution | 2 wks | Charlie | ‚Ä¢ Build `reflection_engine.py` that classifies failure reasons<br>‚Ä¢ `evolution_controller.py` applies simple prompt-edit operator, writes temp YAML, reruns harness<br>‚Ä¢ Streamlit panel lets human accept/reject proposal | On failing test, system produces candidate agent with improved score that reviewer can approve. |
| 6. UI, CI/CD, Documentation | 1 wk | Alice | ‚Ä¢ Expand Streamlit: component browser, trace viewer (json ‚Üí tree)<br>‚Ä¢ GitHub Actions: lint + test matrix<br>‚Ä¢ Publish full docs site (mkdocs) with Parts 1-5 + code examples | PR must pass CI; docs build without warnings; non-core dev can follow manual to run UI on a fresh machine. |
| **BETA Release** | **‚Äì** | ALL | Tagged release `v0.5.0-beta`, changelog, demo video | Public testers can install, run UI, execute evaluations on their own dataset. |

#### Cross-Cutting Tasks & Notes

1. Security review: ensure no user input reaches `eval`, shell, or unrestricted HTTP.  
2. Telemetry: adopt OpenTelemetry JSON schema for logs early to avoid later migration.  
3. Testing culture: aim for >80 % coverage on core modules (`schemas`, `builder`, `BT`, `evaluation`).  
4. Performance guard: run a weekly benchmark to monitor latency & memory.  
5. Community readiness: finish `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, create issue & PR templates before beta.

---

### Immediate Next Actions (this week)

1. **Create GitHub project board** with the above phases as milestones.  
2. **Merge** Parts 1-5 docs into `/docs/` and link from README.  
3. **Generate initial `pyproject.toml`** and move dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
4. **Draft detailed task tickets** for Phase 1 (schema tests, builder hot-path, executor).  
5. Schedule **sandbox design spike** meeting (Alice lead) to pick Docker vs. Python cages.

With the specification now complete and a concrete execution plan in place, the team is positioned to ship a functional, safe, and extensible Agent Forge beta in roughly three months.
